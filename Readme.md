# 🎓 RealTime Teacher — AI Classroom Copilot

> **The first AI system designed to assist teachers *during* live instruction — powered by Google Gemini 3**

**RealTime Teacher** transforms classroom teaching with real-time AI support that listens, observes, and adapts as lessons unfold.  
Built specifically for the cognitive demands of live instruction, it's the teaching assistant every educator needs — but schools can’t afford to hire.
